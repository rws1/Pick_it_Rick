Initial Idea to be discussed with rest of the team members for edits and approval: 
The game involves Players/Recyclers (two at a time) as characters (yet to be defined) entering the landfill to dig for valuable items. The palyers will have to dig for valuable items while avoiding the hidden dangers (such as toxic waste) in the time frame provided. Running into hidden danger will decrease the points collected and collecting valuable items will increae the score. Winner will be determined by the final score collected. Optional element- the players will be given a gem or harm-detector based on their recycling knowledge.  

Questions for Ben:-
1. Is this game format more ambitious?
2. Do two players hve to play at the same time or scores can be collected and stored to be compared in retrospect?
3. How much score will be given to the fun element of the game and how much will be given to the functional element of the game?
4. What will be the main milestone of the game? How much guidance will be given as we have not done this before ;)?

Milstones to be achieved:-
1. The final game format on paper
2. Identify objects in the game that need to be coded - e.g. characters/Recyclers, landfill elements (tiles)- good tiles and bad tiles, digging tool, score meter,score attributes- how will the game be scored- good tile = 1 point and bad tile = -1 point etc?
3. Animations needed and associated coding- movements, digging etc - 
4. Coding preferences and formats for the objects identified- distribution of labour :D 
5. Compilation of all elements/objects

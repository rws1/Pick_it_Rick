Initial Idea to be discussed with the rest of the team members for edits and approval: 
The game involves Players/Recyclers (two at a time) as characters (yet to be defined) entering the landfill to dig for valuable items. The players will have to dig for valuable items while avoiding the hidden dangers (such as toxic waste) in the time frame provided. Running into hidden danger will decrease the points collected and collecting valuable items will increase the score. Winner will be determined by the final score collected. Optional element- the players will be given a gem or harm-detector based on their recycling knowledge.

# Dig.It-Private-Under-Covers-p
Behind the screen footage for final commits on Public Dig.It GitHub (yes, its super cheeky!)

Why another Private GitHub for Dig.It - To freely log in weekly tasks which will be redistributed (either by choice or by delegation)
for thrice weekly commits on Public Dig.It to ensure the perception of equal distribution of labour by all team members.

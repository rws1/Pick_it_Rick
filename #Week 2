To do:-
1. Read Details for Week 1 and Week 2 in Milestones file
2. The week 2 game details need to be well defined hence I suggest we will meet for an hour on Wednesday and Thursday to
make offical commits on Friday
3. For this please read week 2 details in Milestones file and in the interest of time, pick your options for each aspect 
so that when we meet tomorrow we can discuss targeted points or any other details that have been missed.
4. Please add any points that have been missed. 
5. On wednesday we will distribute work amongst ourselves which can be discussed and accessed in the next day's (Thursday's)
meeting.

//Sound
//For now we can't use sound on code.9leap.net, as it doesn't allow us to add sound files to the resources. I'll still explain how to use it, in case you'd like to download the resource files and work on it on your own.

//First, we preload the sound file like we did with the image files. For our example, let's say there's a sound file called 'ping.wav'. Just add it to the end of the preload function like so:

	
game.preload('icon0.png', 'diamond-sheet.png', 'bg.png', 'ping.wav');
	
//Once it's been preloaded, we can use it like any of our other assets. Add this under Gem's onenterframe function with the collision detection code:
	
game.assets['ping.wav'].play();
	
//Now when the player touches the gem, the sound will play as the gem is removed from the game.






//If you want to do something like play music that loops, begin by preloading the song file, playing it in the game's initialize function, and add this code to the game's enterframe function:
	
if(this.bgm.currentTime >= this.bgm.duration ){
    this.bgm.play();
}
	
//This will start the music up again once the track stops playing.
